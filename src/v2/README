=====================================> The Binding of Mino <=============================================
                Programming class project, Alma Mater Studiorum - UniversitÃ  di Bologna.

Written in C++, meant to be compiled with the gcc/make toolchain. 
Uses the ncurses library.

How to run the game:
1. Make sure to have installed the mandatory ncurses dev headers (if you're using a Linux distro,
   the package providing them is probably called "ncurses-devel" or alike, refer to your package manager and distro documentation)
2. compile the program using 'make' (although it's possible to compile without the make tool, it's STRONGLY 
   recommended to do so)
3. run the game with the command './main'
